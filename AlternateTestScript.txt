Are there fixed thresholds for grades?No.
Will there be curving of grade?Yes
What have the grade statistics for this class been in the past?For the Fall 2015 KBAI class, the average was in the low 80's, and only about 10% of the class ended with a raw score over 90; well over half the class still received an A, though

For Assignments 2, we will provide a list of problems that you can choose from. For Assignments 3, you may choose from that same list, or you may select a problem of your own.
What advantages does peer-to-peer feedback provide me?Peer-to-peer feedback provides a number of opportunities: it gives you the opportunity to see your classmates' work, it gets you more feedback on your work than you would otherwise receive, and it puts you in the position of critiquing and analyzing course material.

Third, it teaches the relationship between knowledge-based artificial intelligence and the study of human cognition.
What is the structure of this course?The structure of this course is driven by several pedagogical motivations: learning by example, learning by doing, project-based learning, personalization, collaborative learning, peer-to-peer learning, self-reflection and authenticity.
What will I learn in this class?At the conclusion of this class: first you will have learned to be able to design and implement a knowledge-based artificial intelligence agent that can address a complex task using the methods discussed in the course. Second, you will be able to use this agent to reflect on the process of human cognition. Third, you will be able to use both these practices to address practical problems in multiple domains.
What is the Technical Report?The Technical Report is a document that provides more detailed accounts of learning goals, strategies, and outcomes of this course.
How is this class taught?Each topic is taught through examples of the way in which humans and artificial intelligence agents approach certain problems, often building from human thought toward AI agents and subsequently referring back to human cognition.
How does this course encourage Learning by Doing?Students will participate in the reasoning within each particular lesson, and subsequently tie the topic back to a broader problem.
How does this course utilize Project Based Learning strategies?This class has three projects, each of which build on the previous one, and the overall goals and motivations of KBAI are presented through these projects.
Is Collaborative Learning allowed?We encourage collaboration and the development of communities of practice surrounding the course material and projects. We are excited to see students borrow one another’s ideas and build on them, as well as spin off on their own study groups.
How does Peer-to-Peer Learning work?During this class, students will give their peers feedback on their work for completed assignments. This lets students see additional approaches to the problems, provides extra feedback, and puts students in the position of a teacher, which has been shown to be a pedagogically useful role reversal.
How does this course encourage Self-Reflection?At the conclusion of each lesson, each student is asked to reflect on what they learned in the class. Each design project requires the writing of a project reflection that explains and critiques, and reflects on the student’s work on the project.
How does this course ensure Authenticity?The project that is explored in this class is an open research question in the AI and Cognitive Systems research communities. Two students from our lab have completed dissertations working on these questions in the past two years, and we have had papers published on these topics within the past several months.
